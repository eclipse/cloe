/**
 * \file cloe/plugin.hpp
 * \see  cloe/version.hpp
 *
 * This file enables controllers, simulators, and components to be easily used
 * as plugins.
 *
 * The library is never unloaded, so we can forget about the handle.  It does
 * mean that we leak it in the end though, so that might show up in valgrind or
 * similar tools.
 *
 * All controller plugins that we load should be compiled to the correct
 * version. This is a precaution that will probably save us a lot of grief in
 * the long run IF we keep bumping the versions found in <cloe/version.hpp>.
 *
 * # Debugging Plugins
 *
 * If you run into any troubles when loading a plugin, make sure that the
 * appropriate symbols are exported:
 *
 *   $ nm your_plugin.so | grep -e 'plugin_manifest\|create_factory'
 *   0000000000027949 T create_factory
 *   000000000033ba30 D plugin_manifest
 *
 * If that looks good, then possibly you need to recompile your plugin
 * with the same version of Cloe that you are trying to load it with.

 * This macro makes the given factory available to Cloe as a plugin.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * Given your component binding FooBar with its factory FooBarFactory, you can,
 * in your main source file, export it as a plugin for Cloe:
 *
 *     namespace foobar {
 *
 *     class FooBarFactory : public ControllerFactory {
 *       // ... implementation ...
 *     };
 *
 *     } // namespace foobar
 *
 *     EXPORT_CLOE_PLUGIN(foobar::FooBarFactory)
 *
 * The macro call should not be followed by a semicolon, it should appear in
 * the global namespace, and it should only be called on classes that inherit
 * from one of the supported plugin types: ControllerFactory, SimulatorFactory,
 * and ComponentFactory. The macro argument should be a fully-qualified name
 * of the factory.
