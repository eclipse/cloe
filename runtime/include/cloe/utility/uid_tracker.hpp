 * UniqueIDTracker maintains a mapping from objects to unique IDs, reusing
 * objects as far as possible.
 *
 * It fulfills the following requirements:
 *
 *  1. InIDs are given the same OutIDs within their time to live.
 *  2. If there are no free IDs, the OutID with the greatest age is removed and
 *     replaced.
 *  3. If there is no free OutID with an age > ttl (time-to-live), then an
 *     exception is thrown.
 *  4. The age for all IDs is increased by a call to Next();
 *
 * Currently, the implementation does not remove a mapped ID unless it has not
 * been seen for ttl time. Therefore, if ttl is 1, then it will be reserved for
 * one cycle it is not seen. A ttl of smaller than one makes no sense, and is
 * considered a programmer error.
