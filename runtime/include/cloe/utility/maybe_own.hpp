 * maybe_own is a unique_ptr that sometimes has a no-op deleter,

 *
 * The best way to use this class is by using the C++11 initializer lists:
 * ```
 * maybe_own<MyClass> mp;
 * MyClass c;
 * mp = {&c, false};  // not-owned
 *
 * MyClass* cp = new MyClass();
 * mp = {cp, true};  // owned, c not deleted
 *
 * mp = {new MyClass(), true};  // owned, cp now deleted
 * ```
