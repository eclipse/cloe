# libcloe-runtime.so, so we need to explicitely set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#
# This image can now be used to work with stack files. You should mount in
# whatever directory contains your stack files for best results, otherwise
# the engine might try to read files that it doesn't have in its own filesystem.
