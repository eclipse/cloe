Note on `test_v2_package`.

The standard naming for the test package is `test_package`.
Conan will pick this up automatically and then build it.
However, when using a lockfile, Conan runs into an error
when trying to build this lockfile.

Once we have migrated to using Conan 2.0, we will rename this
directory to `test_package`.
