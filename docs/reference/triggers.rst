Triggers
========

.. highlight:: json

Cloe provides a way to trigger actions based on simulation state.

.. note::

   This section contains a basic overview of how to use triggers.
   To gain a perspective on the design considerations of triggers,
   see the :doc:`trigger design documentation <../design/triggers>`.

A trigger is defined by a JSON object that specifies a trigger event and
a trigger action (and optionally, a label)::

   {
     "label": "What this trigger is all about",
     "event": { "name": "start" },
     "action": { "name": "stop" }
     "source": "filesystem",
     "conceal": false,
     "sticky": false,
   }

Each event and action can be chosen from a pre-defined set of
:doc:`available events <events>` and :doc:`available actions <actions>`.
This *must* be specified as the name of the event or action.
Each such event or action may optionally read from further fields in the
JSON object, such as the ``time`` event, which reads a number from the
``time`` field::

   { "name": "time", "time": 45.2 }

Or like the ``command`` action, which reads a string from the ``command``
field::

   { "name": "command", "command": "echo 'Hello World!'" }

.. note::
   All these names and fields are case-sensitive. In general, all names and
   fields should be in ``lower_snake_case``.

Inline Format
-------------

Because this can become ardous quickly, a short-hand *inline* syntax is
supported for certain selected events and actions. In this form, instead of
a JSON object, we have a string containing the name and at most a single
argument::

   [
     { "event": "start", "action": "stop" },
     { "event": "time=45.2", "action": "command=echo 'Hello World!'" }
   ]


Usage with Cloe
---------------

Cloe can read individual triggers from the triggers section in the
:doc:`stack file <config>`. These triggers can also be in a file by themselves,
but this still must adhere to the Cloe stack-file requirements, such as::

   {
      "version": "4",
      "triggers": [
         { "event": "start", "action": "realtime_factor=-1" },
         { "event": "time=60", "action": "stop" }
      ]
   }


JSON vs YAML
""""""""""""

Since JSON is a subset of YAML, you may also use YAML in conjunction with a
converter or wrapper, which can lead to a much more readable triggers section.
Compare the following trigger representations. In JSON::

   {
     "triggers": [
       {
         "event": "plugin/aeb_activation",
         "action": {
           "name": "insert",
           "triggers": [
             { "event": "next", "action": { "name": "plugin/steering_torque", "left": 50.0 } }
             { "event": "future=0.05", "action": {
               "name": "insert",
               "triggers": [
                 { "event": "plugin/aeb_activation", "action": "fail" }
               ]
             }}
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }

In YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

   triggers:
   # When AEB activates:
   - event: plugin/aeb_activation
     action:
       name: insert
       triggers:

       # 1. Rip the steering wheel to the left, and
       - event: next
         action:
           name: plugin/steering_torque
           left: 50.0

       # 2. Fail if after 500ms the AEB is still activated
       - event: future=0.05
         action:
           name: insert
           triggers:
           - event: plugin/aeb_activation
             action: fail

Interactive Triggers
""""""""""""""""""""

Dynamic interactions with the simulation are achieved through the trigger
interface. This occurs under-the-hood and is transparent to the user. The
significant advantage it brings is that the order of interactions is
well-defined and traceable.

Trigger History
"""""""""""""""

In order to make the triggers that interact with a simulation traceable and
apparent, each trigger that is activated is saved in a special trigger history
container. This can be saved in a file to reproduce the simulation in exactly
the same way. There are four possibilities available for saving the trigger
history, in no particular order:

#. Insert a trigger::

      {
        "event": "finish",
        "action": "command=wget http://localhost:8080/api/triggers/history -O /tmp/trigger_history.json"
      }

#. Set ``/engine/keep_alive`` to ``true`` and fetch the history via the JSON
   API once the simulation is complete.

#. Set ``/engine/output/files/triggers`` to a file that the trigger output should
   be stored in.

#. Use the Cloe UI.
