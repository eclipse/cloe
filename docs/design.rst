Design Resolutions
==================

Creating a simulation framework with as many moving parts as the entire Cloe
system contains is not trivial work. A lot of thought goes into how the various
parts are designed. This chapter details some of these requirements and design
considerations. The details in this chapter are not necessary implemented,
but they represent current considerations and planning.

We use the term "Cloe Design Resolution" (CDR) to describe each of these design
considerations, similar to PEPs in Python.

See :doc:`design/0001-cdr` for insight into how the CDRs work and how to create
a new one.
