Usage Guides
============

This chapter contains usage guides and tutorials for various Cloe use-cases.
Presently, it contains guides for the most basic tasks -- but these should be
seen as prerequisites for doing anything else with Cloe. Completing these
guides will give you a better feel for how Cloe works and how it is built up.
