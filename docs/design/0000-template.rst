Template CDR
============

| **Status:** DRAFT
| **Issue:** URL

The first paragraph should act as an abstract of what the CDR is all about.
When a CDR is in development, it does not have a number. Instead, it just
has a filename.

Motivation
----------
The motivation section should describe the problem and any other motivation
behind the CDR.

Proposal #1
-----------
The first proposal.

Alternative #2
--------------
An alternative proposal. If there is only one proposal then consider detailing
the consequences of inaction.

You don't have to use the terms "Proposal" or "Alternative" if you feel it
doesn't correctly convey the content of the CDR.

Conclusion

Your recommendation on which proposal to adopt.

FAQ
---
If you feel there are questions that can be answered.
