Creating a New Release
======================

In principle, creating a release is nothing more than adding a version
tag for a particular commit. In practice, we want to provide more:

1. Consistent and relevant documentation.
2. A "blog" entry describing the release in approachable language.
3. A "changelog" entry with detailed list of all changes.
4. A new tag in the Read-The-Docs configuration.

Providing these requires more work up-front.
