Python Guidelines
=================

Python is a powerful language that is simultaneously easy to use. This feature
helps us to get started with Python, but it is up to us to challenge ourselves
and so learn more of the capabilities that Python offers.

There are two major Python versions which can be used namely Python 2 and
Python 3. As Python 2 support is announced to be discontinued in the near
future you should choose Python 3. Besides most Cloe Python code has been
migrated to Python 3.

You should at least read `PEP-8`_,
which is the official Python style guide.

Code editors like Visual Studio Code integrate tools like pylint or autopep8
which can help you following and applying the mentioned guidelines e.g. each
time you save your code files.

Additionally there are good textbooks available which you can learn from how
to proficiently write your applications in a "pythonic" way. The following
books are owned and used by the Cloe team:

    * Effective Python by Brett Slatkin (Addision-Wesley)
    * Python Cookbook by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones (O'Reilly)
    * Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho (O'Reilly)
