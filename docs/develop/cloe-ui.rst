Cloe UI
=======

Cloe UI is a web-app; it runs in a browser. Since it uses some modern
techniques and libraries, you will need a modern browser in one of the latest
versions (Firefox 54+, Chrome 58+) to use it.

.. note::
   Internet Explorer is not officially supported by Cloe UI!

Starting the UI as a Docker container can be achieved relatively easily::

   docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 dtr.cucumber.tld/cloe/cloe-ui:live
