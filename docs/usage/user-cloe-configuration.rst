User Cloe Configuration
=======================

In the previous section we saw how multiple stackfiles can be merged into
a single one. Sometimes, a user might want to augment every simulation with
their own configuration. One way to do that is to pass an extra "user
stackfile" to each call to ``cloe-engine``. Another method is to use the user
configuration, which will be introduced in this section.
