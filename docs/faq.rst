Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What 3rd-party libraries do you use?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We use several open source libraries as part of Cloe, some of which we ship with
the Cloe source code. These can found in the `vendor/` directory. The list of
Cloe dependencies and these included libraries and their licenses can be found
in the ``LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt`` file.

We provide simulator bindings to two commercial simulators. These bindings use
development files from these simulators, in part through simple includes,
in part through patch-files, as is technologically necessary.
