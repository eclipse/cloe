/**
 * \file minimator.cpp
 *
 * This file defines the minimator example simulator plugin.
 *
 * In principle, creating a simulator binding for Cloe is fairly simple. You
 * must create a dynamic library that contains a plugin manifest that defines
 * a factory that creates objects that fulfill the `cloe::Simulator` interface.
 * (After introducing a class we will omit the `cloe::` scope specification for
 * brevity.)
 *
 * The `Simulator` interface is little more than a `cloe::Model` that provides
 * access to one or more `cloe::Vehicle`. As such it has a lot in common with
 * all other models, such as `cloe::Controller` and `cloe::Component`.
 *
 * We have then, the following situation:
 *
 *    1. `Minimator` is a `Simulator`, which is a `Model`.
 *       \see cloe/simulator.hpp
 *       \see cloe/model.hpp
 *
 *    2. `Minimator` provides `MinimatorVehicle`, which is a `Vehicle`.
 *       \see cloe/vehicle.hpp
 *
 *    3. A `MinimatorFactory` is exported with `EXPORT_CLOE_PLUGIN`.
 *       \see cloe/plugin.hpp
 *
 * A factory or simulator isn't much good to us if we can't configure it. We
 * use the `Fable` library for this purpose. This is included in the Cloe
 * runtime and is available in the `cloe` namespace as well as the original
 * `fable` namespace.

   * dealing with a vehicle from the 1970s for all we know -- but such

   *   - Ego sensor. This provides information on the vehicle itself, such as
   *     how fast the vehicle is traveling or where it is in the world.
   *   - Object sensor. This provides information on the world outside of the
   *     vehicle, such as would come from a video camera or radar.
   *   - Actuator. This lets of send actuation commands to the vehicle, such
   *     as an acceleration or a steering angle.
   *
   * We would normally create our own implementation of these sensors, based
   * on our feature set, but since this is a super-minimalistic simulator,
   * we'll use dummy sensors.
