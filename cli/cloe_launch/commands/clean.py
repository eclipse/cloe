Implementation for cloe-launch command clean.

Usage: cloe-launch clean CONANFILE
"""

import os
import shutil

import click

from cloe_launch import Configuration
from cloe_launch.exec import Engine
from . import options


@click.command("clean")
@click.option("--all", is_flag=True, help="Clean all runtime environments.")
@options.conanfile()
@click.pass_obj
def cli_clean(
    conf: Configuration,
    all: bool,
    conanfile: str,
):
    """Clean launcher runtime environment for specified configuration.

    The runtime environment is by default at `~/.cache/cloe/launcher/`
    in a directory named after a hash calculated from the conanfile.
    Currently, the hash does not take additional arguments into account
    (this should change in the future).

    It is safe to clean a configuration or all configurations.
    Almost all commands will regenerate these configurations if needed
    within a few seconds. However, the following cases should be noted:

    \b
    1. If the `deploy` command is used with a configuration,
       an uninstall script is stored in the cache.
       This should be preserved if you want to completely
       remove a deployed configuration at a later time.
    2. If the output of the `activate` command is used,
       for example in the `.bashrc` file,
       then you should not clean the configuration.

    Usage Examples:

    \b
        cloe-launch clean tests/conanfile.py
        cloe-launch clean -a
